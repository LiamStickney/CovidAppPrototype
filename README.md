# HCI-Assignment2
Liam Stickney's assignment 2 for the Human Computer Interaction class.

This application prototype represents a COVID-19 application for specific use in Ontario, Canada. As it currently stands, the application allows the user to sign up using an email and password, or to log-in using an existing account. Once logged in, the user is able to view a scrolling feed of recent Ontario Covid-19 news reports, as well as an option to view their profile, view Covid statistics, visit the news archive, enter the live chat or check their symptoms.

The profile page allows the user to enter extra information about themselves, including their gender and age, and also allows them to change their name and email. The stats page allows the user to view up-to-date Covid-19 statistics in Ontario, Canada and worldwide. The news archive contains older news articles that the user may be interested in. The live chat menu displays several chat rooms as well as the number of people in each room. Each room has a specific topic delegated to it. Finally, the symptoms page lists out a list of common Covid-19 symptoms and a link to the official Ontario testing site in case the user would like to get tested.
