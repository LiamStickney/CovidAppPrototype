# Covid-19 Companion App Prototype
This application prototype represents a COVID-19 application for specific use in Ontario, Canada. As it currently stands, the application allows the user to sign up using an email and password, or to log-in using an existing account. Once logged in, the user is able to view a scrolling feed of recent Ontario Covid-19 news reports, as well as an option to view their profile, view Covid statistics, visit the news archive, enter the live chat or check their symptoms.

The profile page allows the user to enter extra information about themselves, including their gender and age, and also allows them to change their name and email. The stats page allows the user to view up-to-date Covid-19 statistics in Ontario, Canada and worldwide. The news archive contains older news articles that the user may be interested in. The live chat menu displays several chat rooms as well as the number of people in each room. Each room has a specific topic delegated to it. Finally, the symptoms page lists out a list of common Covid-19 symptoms and a link to the official Ontario testing site in case the user would like to get tested.

# Desirable Functionalitiles

1. The ability to schedule a Covid-19 test from inside the application. This would likely need to be done in some sort of official government application, but the ability to schedule a Covid-19 test directly from the application would save the users time in having to schedule their own by visiting several websites or by making phone calls.

2. The ability to view nearby testing facilities and view how booked they are. This would go hand-in-hand with the first feature, but the ability to view nearby testing areas would save the user from having to find them themselves. Also, I know first-hand that finding the availablity of a testing centre can be a hassle, so having it all in one place would be very convenient.

3. Some sort of risk calculator based on the user's current location. This could factor in the information from the user's profile as well (age and gender) and also ask the user a short survey (how often they go out, where they go out, etc). Based on this info, there could be some sort of algorithm that calculates the risk that user has on a day-to-day basis (perhaps a percantage scale), and what they can do to lower that risk.

4. A map that displays local stores and shopping areas and an option to view how busy they currently are. There is a similar feature on Google already, that displays how busy a store typically is at certain times of the day. If the user is able to see this directly inside the application, they could schedule their shopping trips around the busier times of the day. This feature could also be used with the previous feature to lower someone's risk of infection.

5. Similar to the third feature, but some sort of risk calculator for an entire region. User's could view a local, and the application could weigh in factors like population, size of the region, confirmed cases, etc. to weigh how risky visiting that area could be. This could help users make informed decisions about where they should visit during the pandemic.
